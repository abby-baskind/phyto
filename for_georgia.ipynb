I've been using `gsw.density.rho(S, T, p)`, which returns in situ density. We have temperature and salinity already in our data, but we must provide pressure. To do this, I create a new column in our dataframe for pressure and say pressure is 0 everywhere, since these samples are being analyzed in the lab where pressure is only from the atmosphere (the function inherently accounts for atmospheric pressure). Notably, since TA and DIC are generalized measured on different days, we have to use different temperatures and thus different densities for both TA and DIC."
